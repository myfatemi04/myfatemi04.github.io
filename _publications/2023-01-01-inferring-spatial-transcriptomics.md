We assess the ability for machine learning models to infer gene expression levels across tissue samples. We prototyped and compared several convolutional, transformer, and graph convolutional neural networks to predict spatial RNA patterns at the Visium spots under the hypothesis that the transformer- and graph-based approaches better capture relevant spatial tissue architecture. We further analyzed the modelâ€™s ability to recapitulate spatial autocorrelation statistics using SPARK and SpatialDE.
