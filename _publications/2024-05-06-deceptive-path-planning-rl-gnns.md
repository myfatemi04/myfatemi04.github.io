In this paper, I develop robotic path planning techniques using deep reinforcement learning with graph neural networks. I conducted this research as part of a summer program with the University of Maryland and the US Army Research Lab. I improved upon a prior version of a robotic path planning algorithm by enabling inference at a 30x higher speed on 100x larger environments. I will be presenting this as a poster at AAMAS 2024 (International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems).
