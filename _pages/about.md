Hi, I'm Michael Yoo Fatemi, an undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Virginia/UVA. I'm broadly interested in robotics and intelligent systems. This summer, I will be in Sunnyvale as an AI Resident at [1X Robotics](https://1x.tech/) working on foundation world models to train humanoid robots.

**I will be applying for a PhD in 2025 Fall. Please feel free to reach out, I would appreciate any connections!**

Please check out my [blog posts](/year-archive/) for some fun projects!
